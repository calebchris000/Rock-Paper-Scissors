# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Rock Paper Scissors is a classic hand game played by two people. The rules are simple: each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined by the rules below:

1. Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors)
2. Scissors beats paper (scissors cut paper)
3. Paper beats rock (paper covers rock).

To create a Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript, we can use the prompt function to ask the player for their choice and the alert function to display the results. First, we can create a function that takes in the player's choice as an argument and determines the outcome based on the rules above. Then, we can use prompt to ask the player for their choice and store it in a variable. Next, we can use Math.random to generate a random number for the computer's choice. Finally, we can use alert to display the results of the game.
